# workschedule1
Ever needed a simple application that allows you to keep track of your daily work tasks.
This simple work scheduler allows users to save daily tasks with corresponding time and date. 
Upon loading the application, you will notice that the time and date are color coordinated depending
on if the current time has passed or not. This allows for a simple task scheduler.
